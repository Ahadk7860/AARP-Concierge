# Track D — Notes

Running log for this track. The user reads this alongside the commit history when
reviewing. Append; do not rewrite history here.

This file is how you talk to the user, since you cannot talk to the other agents.
Everything you want to say to somebody outside this worktree goes here.

## Blockers

Anything that stopped progress. For each: what you were doing, what you expected, what
happened, what you tried, and whether it is still open.

Format: `[prompt NN] <OPEN | RESOLVED> — <what and what you tried>`

## Contract gaps

Anything `prompts/CONTRACTS.md` does not specify, specifies wrongly, or specifies in a
way that does not work in practice. You may not edit it — record it here and report.
Every entry names the prompt where it surfaced.

## Shared file changes

Every append to a foundation-owned shared file: dependency manifests, lint config,
`.env.example`. One line each, so the user can anticipate merge conflicts.

Format: `[prompt NN] <file> — added <what> because <why>`

## Runtime resources

Any port, database, cache directory, container name, external path, or rate-limited
credential you needed that `CONTRACTS.md` § 9 does not assign to you. Do not pick a
default — another track may pick the same one. Record it and report.

Format: `[prompt NN] needed <resource> — used <what> provisionally / blocked`

## Requests to other tracks

Things another track owns that you need. You cannot reach across and do it yourself.
Record it, report it, and continue with a local workaround only if the workaround is
visible and reversible.

Format: `[prompt NN] → Track <X>: <what you need and why>`

## Deviations from the plan

Anywhere the implementation departs from what the prompt described, and why. A
deviation is not a failure — an unrecorded one is.

## Decisions made

Choices the prompt left open that you had to resolve: a library, a data structure, an
error-handling approach. The user needs to see these before merge, because another
track may have chosen differently.

## Observations

Anything you noticed that the plan did not anticipate, including work that should exist
but is not in any track's scope. This is often the most useful section at review time.
